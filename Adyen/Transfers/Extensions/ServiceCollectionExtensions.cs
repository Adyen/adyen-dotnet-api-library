/*
 * Transfers API
 *
 * >Versions 1 and 2 of the Transfers API are deprecated. If you are just starting your implementation, use the latest version.  The Transfers API provides endpoints that you can use to transfer funds, whether when paying out to a transfer instrument for [marketplaces](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces/payout-to-users/on-demand-payouts) or [platforms](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/payout-to-users/on-demand-payouts), [sending funds to third parties](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/business-accounts/send-receive-funds) for users with business bank accounts, or to [request a payout for a grant offer](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/capital). The API also supports use cases for [getting transactions for business bank accounts](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/business-accounts/transactions-api) and getting [outstanding balances](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/capital#get-balances) for one or more grants on your platform.   ## Authentication Each request to the Transfers API must be signed with an API key. Generate an API key in your Customer Area if you have a [platform setup](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/manage-access/api-credentials-web-service/#generate-api-key) or [marketplace setup](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces/manage-access/api-credentials-web-service/#generate-api-key).  If you have an Adyen Issuing integration, [generate an API key](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/manage-access/api-credentials-web-service/#generate-api-key) in your Balance Platform Customer Area.  To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:   ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ ... ```  ## Roles and permissions To use the Transfers API, you need an additional role for your API credential. Transfers must also be enabled for the source balance account. Your Adyen contact will set up the roles and permissions for you. ## Versioning The Transfers API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/btl/v4/transfers ``` ## Going live When going live, generate an API key in your [live Customer Area](https://ca-live.adyen.com/ca/) if you have an Adyen for Platforms integration or [live Balance Platform Customer Area](https://balanceplatform-live.adyen.com/balanceplatform/) if you have an Adyen Issuing integration. You can then use the API key to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/btl/v4`.
