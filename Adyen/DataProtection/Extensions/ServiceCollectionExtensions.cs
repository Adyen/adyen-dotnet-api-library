/*
 * Adyen Data Protection API
 *
 * Adyen Data Protection API provides a way for you to process [Subject Erasure Requests](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/) as mandated in GDPR.  Use our API to submit a request to delete shopper's data, including payment details and other related information (for example, delivery address or shopper email).## Authentication Each request to the Data Protection API must be signed with an API key. Get your API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:  ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\ ... ``` Note that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).  ## Versioning Data Protection Service API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DataProtectionService/v1/requestSubjectErasure ```
