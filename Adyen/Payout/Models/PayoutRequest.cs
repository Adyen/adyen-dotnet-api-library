 * Adyen Payout API
 *
 * > The **Payout API is deprecated** and no longer supports new integrations. Do one of the following: >- If you are building a new integration, use the [Transfers API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/transfers/latest/overview) instead. > - If you are already using the Payout API, reach out to your Adyen contact to learn how to migrate to the Transfers API. > > With the Transfers API, you can: > - Handle multiple payout use cases with a single API. > - Use new payout functionalities, such as instant payouts to bank accounts. > - Receive webhooks with more details and defined transfer states. > > For more information about the payout features of the Transfers API, see our [Payouts](https://docs.adyen.com/payouts/payout-service) documentation.   A set of API endpoints that allow you to store payout details, confirm, or decline a payout.  For more information, refer to [Online payouts](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts). ## Authentication To use the Payout API, you need to have [two API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts#payouts-to-bank-accounts-and-wallets): one for storing payout details and submitting payouts, and another one for confirming or declining payouts. If you don't have the required API credentials, contact our [Support Team](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/requests/new).  If using an API key, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:   ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ ... ```  Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using [basic authentication](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#basic-authentication).  The following example shows how to authenticate your request with basic authentication when submitting a payout:  ``` curl -U \"storePayout@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ ... ```  ## Versioning Payments API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v68/payout ```  ## Going live  To authenticate to the live endpoints, you need [API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.  The live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account: ```  https://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v68/payout ```  Get your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.
