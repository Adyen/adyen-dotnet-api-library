 * Adyen Payment API
 *
 * A set of API endpoints that allow you to initiate, settle, and modify payments on the Adyen payments platform. You can use the API to accept card payments (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank transfers, ewallets, and many other payment methods.  To learn more about the API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-integration).  ## Authentication You need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) to authenticate to the API.  If using an API key, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:   ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ ... ```  Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication, for example:  ``` curl -U \"ws@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ ... ```  ## Versioning Payments API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v68/authorise ```  ## Going live  To authenticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.  The live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account: ```  https://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v68/authorise ```  Get your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.

If you need to process a payment with an acquirer different from a default one, you can set up a corresponding configuration on the Adyen payments platform. Then you can pass a custom routing flag in a payment request&#39;s additional data to target a specific acquirer.

This field is required for token-based transactions where Adyen does not tokenize the card.  Transaction identifier from card schemes, for example, Mastercard Trace ID or the Visa Transaction ID.  Submit the original transaction ID of the contract in your payment request if you are not tokenizing card details with Adyen and are making a merchant-initiated transaction (MIT) for subsequent charges.  Make sure you are sending &#x60;shopperInteraction&#x60; **ContAuth** and &#x60;recurringProcessingModel&#x60; **Subscription** or **UnscheduledCardOnFile** to ensure that the transaction is classified as MIT.</param>
