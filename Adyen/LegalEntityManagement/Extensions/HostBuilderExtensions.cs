/*
 * Legal Entity Management API
 *
 * The Legal Entity Management API enables you to manage legal entities that contain information required for verification.  ## Authentication Each request to the Legal Entity Management API must be signed with an API key. Generate an API key in your Customer Area if you have a [platform setup](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/manage-access/api-credentials-web-service/#generate-api-key) or [marketplace setup](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces/manage-access/api-credentials-web-service/#generate-api-key).   If you have an Adyen Issuing integration, [generate an API key](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/manage-access/api-credentials-web-service/#generate-api-key) in your Balance Platform Customer Area.  To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value. For example:  ``` curl -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ ... ``` ## Versioning The Legal Entity Management API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://kyc-test.adyen.com/lem/v4/legalEntities ``` ## Rate limits We enforce rate limits on Legal Entity Management API endpoints. When the number of requests you send exceeds a threshold within a time frame, additional requests are blocked until the time frame ends. Current limits:  - Live environments: 700 requests per 5 seconds.  - Test environments: 200 requests per 5 seconds.  - Failed requests are subject to a limit of 5 failures per 10 seconds.  ## Going live When going live, generate an API key in your [live Customer Area](https://ca-live.adyen.com/ca/) if you have an Adyen for Platforms integration or [live Balance Platform Customer Area](https://balanceplatform-live.adyen.com/balanceplatform/) if you have an Adyen Issuing integration.You can then use the API key to send requests to `https://kyc-live.adyen.com/lem/v4`.
