The local shopper statement field can be supplied in markets where localized merchant descriptors are used. Currently, Adyen only supports this in the Japanese market .The available character sets at the moment are: * Processing in Japan: **ja-Kana** The character set **ja-Kana** supports UTF-8 based Katakana and alphanumeric and special characters. Merchants can use half-width or full-width characters. An example request would be: &gt; {   \&quot;shopperStatement\&quot; : \&quot;ADYEN - SELLER-A\&quot;,   \&quot;localizedShopperStatement\&quot; : {     \&quot;ja-Kana\&quot; : \&quot;ADYEN - セラーA\&quot;   } } We recommend merchants to always supply the field localizedShopperStatement in addition to the field shopperStatement.It is issuer dependent whether the localized shopper statement field is supported. In the case of non-domestic transactions (e.g. US-issued cards processed in JP) the field &#x60;shopperStatement&#x60; is used to modify the statement of the shopper. Adyen handles the complexity of ensuring the correct descriptors are assigned. Please note, this field can be used for only Visa and Mastercard transactions..</param>

If used, this field should be supplied for all incoming authorisations. &gt; We strongly recommend you send the &#x60;merchantOrderReference&#x60; value to benefit from linking payment requests when authorisation retries take place. In addition, we recommend you provide &#x60;retry.orderAttemptNumber&#x60;, &#x60;retry.chainAttemptNumber&#x60;, and &#x60;retry.skipRetry&#x60; values in &#x60;PaymentRequest.additionalData&#x60;..</param>
