/*
 * Configuration API
 *
 * The Configuration API allows you to manage your balance platform where you can create account holders, balance accounts, cards, and business accounts.  ## Authentication Each request to the Configuration API must be signed with an API key. Generate an API key in your Customer Area if you have a [platform setup](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/manage-access/api-credentials-web-service/#generate-api-key) or [marketplace setup](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces/manage-access/api-credentials-web-service/#generate-api-key).   If you have an Adyen Issuing integration, [generate an API key](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/manage-access/api-credentials-web-service/#generate-api-key) in your Balance Platform Customer Area.  To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:   ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ ... ```  ## Versioning The Configuration API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/bcl/v2/accountHolders ``` ## Going live When going live, generate an API key in your [live Customer Area](https://ca-live.adyen.com/ca/) if you have an Adyen for Platforms integration or [live Balance Platform Customer Area](https://balanceplatform-live.adyen.com/balanceplatform/) if you have an Adyen Issuing integration.You can then use the API key to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/bcl/v2`.
