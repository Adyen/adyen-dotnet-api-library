## Prerequisites
- [Adyen test account](https://docs.adyen.com/get-started-with-adyen)
- [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). For testing, your API credential needs to have the [API PCI Payments role](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#roles).
- Adyen dotnet API Library supports .net standard 2.0 and above
- In order for Adyen dotnet API Library to support local terminal api certificate validation the application should be set to .net core 2.1 and above or .net framework 4.6.1 and above

## Installation
Simply download and restore nuget packages https://www.nuget.org/packages/Adyen/
or install it from package manager
```
PM> Install-Package Adyen -Version x.x.x
```
## Using the library

In order to submit http request to Adyen API you need to initialize the client. The following example makes a checkout payment request:
```c#
    using Adyen;
    using Adyen.Model.Checkout;
    using Adyen.Service.Checkout;
    using Environment = Adyen.Model.Environment;

            var config = new Config()
            {
                XApiKey = "your-api-key",
                Environment = Environment.Test
            };
            var client = new Client(config);
            var paymentsService = new PaymentsService(client);
            var amount = new Model.Checkout.Amount("USD", 1000);
            var cardDetails = new CardDetails
            {
                EncryptedCardNumber = "test_4111111111111111",
                EncryptedSecurityCode = "test_737",
                EncryptedExpiryMonth = "test_03",
                EncryptedExpiryYear = "test_2030",
                HolderName = "John Smith",
                Type = CardDetails.TypeEnum.Card
            };
            var paymentsRequest = new Model.Checkout.PaymentRequest
            {
                Reference = "Your order number ",
                ReturnUrl = @"https://your-company.com/...",
                MerchantAccount = "your-merchant-account",
                Amount = amount,
                PaymentMethod = new CheckoutPaymentMethod(cardDetails)
            };
            var paymentResponse = paymentsService.Payments(paymentsRequest);
```
Or in case you would like to make an asynchronous /payments call with idempotency key and cancellation token, the last line would be instead:
```c#
Task<PaymentResponse> paymentResponse = checkout.PaymentsAsync(
                paymentRequest,
                requestOptions: myIdempotencyKey, 
                cancellationToken: myCancellationToken);
```
### Deserializing JSON Strings
In some setups you might need to deserialize JSON strings to request objects. For example, when using the libraries in combination with [Dropin/Components](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-web). Please use the built-in deserialization functions:
~~~~ c#
// Import the required model class
using Adyen.Model.Checkout;

// Deserialize using built-in function
PaymentRequest paymentRequest = PaymentRequest.FromJson("YOUR_JSON_STRING");
~~~~
### Running the tests
Navigate to adyen-dotnet-api-library folder and run the following commands.
```
dotnet build
dotnet test
```
### Using the Cloud Terminal API 
In order to submit POS request with Cloud Terminal API you need to initialize the client with the Endpoints that it is closer to your region. The Endpoints are available as contacts in [ClientConfig](/Adyen/Constants/ClientConfig.cs)
For more information please read our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/terminal-api-fundamentals#cloud)
```c#
//Example for EU based Endpoint Syncronous
using Adyen;
using Adyen.Constants;

var config = new Config
  {
    XApiKey = "Your merchant XAPI key",
    CloudApiEndPoint = ClientConfig.CloudApiEndPointEULive
  };
var client = new Client(config);
```

To parse the terminal API notifications, please use the following custom deserializer. This method will throw an exception for non-notification requests.

~~~~ csharp
var serializer = new SaleToPoiMessageSerializer();
var saleToPoiRequest = serializer.DeserializeNotification(your_terminal_notification);
~~~~

### Example Cloud Terminal API integration
```c#
using System;
using Adyen.Model.TerminalApi;
using Adyen.Model.TerminalApi.Message;
using Adyen.Service;
using Environment = Adyen.Model.Environment;
 
namespace Adyen.Terminal
{
   public static class Program
   {
        private static string XApiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY";
        private static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var client = new Client(XApiKey, Environment.Test);
            TerminalCloudApi terminalCloudApi = new TerminalCloudApi(client);
            SaleToPOIResponse response = terminalCloudApi.TerminalRequestSync(PaymentRequest());
            PaymentResponse paymentResponse = (PaymentResponse) response.MessagePayload;
            Console.WriteLine(paymentResponse.Response.Result);
        }
 
        private static SaleToPOIRequest PaymentRequest()
        {
            var serviceID = "SERVICE_ID"; // ServiceId should be unique for every request
            var saleID = "SALE_ID";
            var POIID = "SERIAL_NUMBER";
            var transactionID = "123459";
            var saleToPOIRequest = new SaleToPOIRequest()
            {
                MessageHeader = new MessageHeader()
                {
                    MessageClass = MessageClassType.Service,
                    MessageCategory = MessageCategoryType.Payment,
                    MessageType = MessageType.Request,
                    ServiceID = serviceID,
                    SaleID = saleID,
                    POIID = POIID
                },
                MessagePayload = new PaymentRequest()
                {
                    SaleData = new SaleData()
                    {
                        SaleTransactionID = new TransactionIdentification()
                        {
                            TransactionID = transactionID,
                            TimeStamp = DateTime.Now
                        }
                    },
                    PaymentTransaction = new PaymentTransaction()
                    {
                        AmountsReq = new AmountsReq()
                        {
                            Currency = "EUR",
                            RequestedAmount = new decimal(10.9)
                        },
                    },
                }
            };
            return saleToPOIRequest;
        }
    }
}
```

### Using the Local Terminal API
The request and response payloads are identical to the Cloud Terminal API, however an additional encryption details object is required to send the requests.
```c#
var encryptionCredentialDetails = new EncryptionCredentialDetails
    {
        AdyenCryptoVersion = 1,
        KeyIdentifier = "CryptoKeyIdentifier12345",
        Password = "p@ssw0rd123456"
    };
var config = new Config
    {
        Environment = Model.Environment.Live,
        LocalTerminalApiEndpoint = @"https://_terminal_:8443/nexo/"
    };
var client = new Client(config);
var terminalLocalApi = new TerminalLocalApi(client);
var saleToPOIResponse = terminalLocalApi.TerminalRequest(paymentRequest, encryptionCredentialDetails);
```
Alternatively one can use the local terminal API without encryption. This is only allowed in the TEST environment and in order for this to work one has to remove any encryption details from the Customer Area.
```c#
var client = new Client(config);
var terminalLocalApiUnencrypted = new TerminalLocalApiUnencrypted(client);
var saleToPOIResponse = terminalLocalApiUnencrypted.TerminalRequest(paymentRequest);
```
To parse the terminal API notifications, please use the following custom deserializer. This method will throw an exception for non-notification requests.
```c#
var serializer = new SaleToPoiMessageSerializer();
var saleToPoiRequest = serializer.DeserializeNotification(your_terminal_notification);
```
Since the terminal API CardAcquisition AdditionalResponse could be either based64 encoded string or key-value pair, there is a helper class to deserialise it to a custom model AdditionalResponse. 
```c#
AdditionalResponse additionalResponse = CardAcquisitionUtil.AdditionalResponse(jsonString);
```



### Parsing BalancePlatform and Management Webhooks
In order to parse banking webhooks, first validate the webhooks (recommended) by retrieving the hmac key from the webhook header and the hmac signature from the Balance Platform CA configuration page respectively.
```c#
using Adyen.Model.ConfigurationWebhooks;
using Adyen.Webhooks;
using Adyen.Util;

...
var hmacValidator = new HmacValidator();
var handler = new BalancePlatformWebhookHandler();
bool isValid = hmacValidator.IsValidWebhook("yourHmacKey", "yourHmacSignature", webhookPayload);

if (isValid) {
    dynamic webhook = handler.GetGenericBalancePlatformWebhook(webhookPayload);
}
```
If you want to handle specific webhook types you're expecting to receive, check the type and retrieve if the type is correct:
```c#
var handler = new BalancePlatformWebhookHandler();
bool isAccountHolderNotification = handler.GetAccountHolderNotificationRequest(json_payload, out AccountHolderNotificationRequest webhook)
// Your logic here based on whether the webhook parsed correctly or not
```
Validating management webhooks is identical to validating the balance platform webhooks. To parse the management webhooks, however, one calls the following handler:
```c#
var handler = new ManagementWebhookHandler();
if(handler.GetMerchantCreatedNotificationRequest(json_payload, out MerchantCreatedNotificationRequest webhook))
{ 
    // Your logic here using the passed through webhook variable
}
```
